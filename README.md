# The intelligent toy car

Early screening, which can lead to early diagnosis and intervention of children with autism (ASD), can significantly improve the life quality of children with autism. The observational process of ASD diagnosis and lack of experts make the technology-based ASD screening methods more necessary. Early ASD screening based on behaviors is one of the most reliable methods that could be done by analyzing children's playing patterns. This paper presents an extension of our initial intelligent toy car functionalities by adding shaft encoders to detect attention to details and interest in rotating objects in children with ASD. , Using the two modalities to detect different ASD symptoms improved our screening accuracy by more than 10%.
